My GitHub Pages is made with Next.js.   
If you create an md files in the posts directory, you can read articles from GitHub Pages.  
I can also post articles from Google Docs. In this case, md files is made by Github action and it is stored google_docs directory. Thanks to [r7kamura/godolog](https://github.com/r7kamura/godolog).
